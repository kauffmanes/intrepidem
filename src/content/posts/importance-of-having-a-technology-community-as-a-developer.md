Humor me and imagine: you’re sitting at your desk surrounded by monitors, a few different browsers open, and maybe Spotify blasting some motivational Jimmy Eat World into your noise-canceling headphones. You’re working on an important new feature that’s due by the end of the sprint and you’re so close. Coding and testing furiously, you refresh the browser expecting to see your glorious creation displayed before you. Instead, you’re greeted with a wall of console errors and warnings. Where did you go wrong? After investigating, you realize the error isn’t your code — it’s resulting from a third-party library or framework that you’re using.

Developers who have worked in any professional capacity are well acquainted with a version of this anecdote. Your artisanal, hand-crafted, beautiful code is perfect. It’s that “other person’s” code that’s messing everything up. If you’re like me, or [82.% of other developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#community-how-often-do-developers-participate-on-stack-overflow) according to the latest developer survey, you might end up on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to see who has had a similar error. If you’re working with a fairly popular technology, it’s pretty likely you’ll at least be able to understand the issue, even if the fix isn’t readily apparent (I still have StackOverflow as my browser homepage. There is really no comparison for seeking and receiving quick help for software questions).

The caveat to this is that it’s really only helpful if you’re working with a technology that is (or was) popular. Try searching for questions tagged with “dotnetnuke” on StackOverflow. At the time of writing, you’ll get around [3,350 results](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dotnetnuke). That’s a decent amount of questions that people in the DNN community have asked and you might find what you’re looking for. Now, compare this to the [138,000+ tagged](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wordpress) that you’ll get with a search for Wordpress (and that doesn’t even include the entire [development community](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/) that Stack Overflow dedicates to Wordpress alone). You’re obviously much more likely to find someone that has run into a similar issue than if you were troubleshooting a DNN module.

Back to our story — if your code isn’t working and you can’t find a well-populated community forum relating to the broken library, you’re “shit out of luck”, as my dad would say. Of course, you can spend your evening troubleshooting and track it down, and you should. But that’s why we HAVE these communities — to build on what others have done and keep moving forward.

As part of my current role, I evaluate third-party extensions for a public-facing university website. If an extension has been around for a year or two and I can’t find an online discussion about issues developers have run into while using it, that’s a red flag. Arguably, you could counter with a chicken-and-the-egg argument stating that these discussions can only happen if people are actively trying to use the software, and so if we don’t take a chance, that community will never grow. In reality, though, we often are working with applications that by necessity have to be very stable and long-term and this can make it difficult to commit without knowing you’ll be able to effectively fix future issues.

## Conclusion

My goal here isn’t to discourage anyone from trying new libraries or frameworks, but only to be cautious when selecting one that has been around for some time, yet has vague documentation or little online discourse. Software improves as bugs are discovered, shared, and fixed. You might find yourself immersed in stagnant code with no one to reach out to for help. And to the organizations that are building public applications, just keep in mind that actively building a community is just as important. Hold regular meetups to tell people why they should use it, give demos, and explain where you plan to go next. If someone runs into an issue — have experts ready to help. People want to be able to trust that using your product will add to the longevity of a project and not become a hindrance a year down the road. Establishing a community establishes trust.
